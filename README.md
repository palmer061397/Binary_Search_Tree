# Binary Search Tree

A binary search tree (BST) is a binary tree data structure in which each node has at most two child nodes, referred to as the left child and the right child, and where the key in each node must be greater than all keys stored in the left sub-tree, and less than all keys in the right sub-tree.

## Description

This Python script implements a Binary Search Tree class. It provides methods to insert nodes, find nodes by value, and traverse the tree using depth-first traversal.

## Usage

1. Import the `random` module.
2. Define a `BinarySearchTree` object.
3. Insert values into the tree.
4. Traverse the tree using depth-first traversal.
